            <p class="j1holheader">Introduction:</p>
            We created the mobile game. In this exercise we will enhance it to share the high scores with other users.
            It common feature of games in todays mobile market. Players like to compete and it's 
            better to compare your results with real players. <br><br>
            We will use Java ME Web Service API (JSR 172) to connect to the web service that collects the high scores. 
            The same web service also provides the latest results to be displayed in the High Score table.<br><br>            
            The NetBeans Mobility includes a wizard for generating  
            the JSR172 stubs for the mobile client that will connect to a web service.<br><br>
            In this step you will not enhance the game functionality itself but you will make 
            the application connected to a server part.
            
            <p class="j1holheader">Steps to follow:</p>
            
            <ul class="j1hollist">
                <li>Create new configuration</li>
                <li>Generate stubs</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="j1holsubheader">Step 1: Create new configuration</p>
            <p> In this step you will create new configuration in your project.
                It will allow us to have two version of the same project. First one will be used for the online game 
                and the second one for offline game.

                </li>
                
            </ol>
            <p class="j1holsubheader">Step 2: Generate stubs</p>
            <p> In this step you will generate a mobile client to the web service. 
            We will use the wizard provided by NetBeans Mobility.</p>
            <ol>                
                <li> Select <b>File > New File...</b> from main menu. 
                    In the <b>New File</b> dialog select <b>MIDP</b> category and <b>Java ME Web Service Client</b>. 
                    Make sure that <i>MobileGameApp</i> project is selected in <b>Project</b> combo box. Click <b>Next</b> button. <br>
                </li>
                
                <li> You have to specify an URL of webservice's WSDL file in this panel. The WSDL can be either a file stored locally on your hard drive or 
                an URL of a webservice at the internet. <br>            
                <a name="WEBSERVICE_URL"></a>Our webservice should be running at following URL : <b>http://193.86.76.42:8080/DukeHighScores/HighScoresService?WSDL</b>
                <br><br>
                <i>If you are not able to access the web service WSDL try to check your network settings. 
                    Sometimes a firewall or antivirus shield can protect you from connecting to the web service. 
                    If the webservice URL is unreachable you can deploy the webservice to application server by yourself. 
                    The project with the webservice is at &lt;lab_root&gt;solutions/solution4 directory. 
                    The name of the project is DukeHighScores.
                </i><br><br>
                <li>
                Select the <b>Running Web Service</b> radio button.</li>
                <li>Type the URL of the webservice to <b>WSDL URL</b> text field. 
                    Click <b>Retrieve WSDL</b> button and, if the WSDL file name automatically
                    appears in the Local Filename field, the WSDL file is successfully downloaded and validated. 
                    <br><br>
                    The validation of the WSDL is mandatory step. 
                    You cannot generate the Java ME Web Service Client to any webservice. There are some restrictions for the webservice defined by the JSR 172. 
                    The webservice has to be WS-I Basic Profile compliant. There is no support for asynchronous messaging. No support for SOAP messages with attachments. 
                    Support only for the literal representation of messages. No support for extensible type mapping. The wizard will report an error message when you cannot 
                    generate the J2ME webservice client for a webservice.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>            
                    The wizard will provide you a default name for the client and package. Change the <b>Package</b> name to <b><i>org.netbeans.j1.game.client</i></b>

                    When you press <b>Finish</b> button the wizard will generate web service client stubs.<br><br>

            <p class="j1holsubheader">Step 3: Use mobile client</p>
            <p>You generated the stubs that will allow you communicate with the web service on a server.
            It is time to use the web service client in the game source code.</p>
            <ol>  
                <li>
                    Add following code to the <b>GameMIDlet.java</b> source code. You can add it to the end of the file.
                    <div class="codebox">
                        <b><pre>

            <p class="j1holheader">Summary:</p>
            
            <p>
                You connected the game with the server side. It is very easy to use the generated stubs.  
                The application is now able to upload your result to server and display the list of best results on your device. 
                <br><br>
                We used J2ME Webservices API to achieve this functionality but the J2ME Webservices API is not supported on lot of device in real world. 
                It is easy to change the client calls to solution not using J2ME Webservice API. You can use the second wizard that NetBeans Mobility provides - "Mobile Client to Web Application".
                The difference between these two solutions is described in "LAB-6340: &lt;Advanced Java ME Programming - Streaming Video From Server to Your Device&gt;" Hands-on lab
