            <p class="j1holheader">Introduction:</p>
            
            <p>
                The logic of our game is quite simple. There is the Duke creature walking in a maze. 
                The Duke is looking for James Gosling who is lost somewhere in the maze. 
                When he finds James the game ends.<br>
                
                We created the sprites in previous exercise. We also created one level of our game.<br><br>
                
                Duke can move left and right. He can jump. When there is no floor under his feets then he starts falling. 
                <br>
                The code for movement of the duke is based on the example provided by Carol Hamer in <a href="http://apress.com/book/view/1590598806">"Creating Mobile Games: Using Java ME Platform to Put the Fun into Your Mobile Device and Cell Phone" by Appress</a>.

            <p class="j1holheader">Steps to follow:</p>
            
            <ul class="j1hollist">
                <li>Initialize the MazeManager</li>
                <li>Let the duke move</li>
                
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p class="j1holsubheader">Step 1: Initialize the MazeManager</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    There are following classes created for you in the <b>org.netbeans.j1.game.logic</b> package that
                    take care about processing the game. The GameTread.java class runs in separate thread to 
                    not block the game ui. The MazeManager.java class takes care about the interaction among the 
                    sprites and tiled layers in the game.<br><br>
                    At first we have to initialize all the game parts. Copy and paste code in bold to init method 
                    of the MazeManager class.
                    <div class="codebox">

    public void init() throws Exception {    
        //TODO: [Exercise 3][step 1] - initialization code. Please, don't forget to fix the missing imports and fields
 <b>       mazeDesign = new MazeGameDesign(); //[Exercise3]
        jamesSprite = mazeDesign.getJamesS();//[Exercise3]

        dukeSprite.defineReferencePixel(dukeSprite.getWidth() / 2, 0);//[Exercise3]

        mazeDesign.updateLayerManagerForLevel1(this);//[Exercise3]

        timer = new Timer();//[Exercise3]
        timer.scheduleAtFixedRate(dukeSpriteAnimator, 0, mazeDesign.dukeSseq001Delay);//[Exercise3]</b>
        // this sets the view screen so that the player is 
        // in the center.
        myViewWindowX = dukeSprite.getX() - ((DISP_HEIGHT - SQUARE_WIDTH) / 2);
        myViewWindowY = dukeSprite.getY() - ((DISP_HEIGHT - SQUARE_WIDTH) / 2);

        System.gc();
                        }                        </pre>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Fix the missing import for MazeGameDesign class.
                    You can use the hint bulb to fix the code. Just press the bulb on the glyph or ALT+ENTER on the line with errors.<br><br>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Create new field <b>mazeDesign</b> in the class. You can use the hint again.

                    Now the game is ready to be played. You can run the application.

                    It can be done in <b>MazeManager</b> class in method <b>updateSprite</b>. 
                    Just uncomment the four lines ending with //TODO: [Exercise 3][step 2].
                    It will add the code that changes the sequence of tiles for duke sprite. 
                    Therefore the duke will either walk or fall or jump.

                The source code of the updateSprite() method will look in following way. The bold lines are the uncommented ones.

            <p>
                You created necessary logic for the game. You can now play the game. As you can see the work with the Sprites and TiledLayers 
                is quite simple thank to the Game API. The game logic isn't so complicated however the description of it is beyond scope 
                of this hands-on lab class. The source code is well described with comments and javadoc therefore you can study it later.
